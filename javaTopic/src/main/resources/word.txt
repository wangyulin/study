Published RFCs never change. Although every published RFC has been
submitted to careful proofreading by the RFC Editor and the author(s),
errors do sometimes go undetected. Technical Errata are errors in
the technical content. Editorial Errata are spelling, grammar,
punctuation, or syntax errors that do not affect the technical meaning.
